## About

This is Bamazon; its a lot like amazon except in node.

When node is running the first thing that will come up will be a table that shows (from left to right) ID number, product name, department name, price and quantity.

Following that will be a prompt asking what you would like to buy today. To make that selection type the ID number in the beginning of the row. Type your number and press enter.

Once you have selected an item you will be prompted how many items would you like to buy? Type your number and press enter.

A confirmation will then show that a row has been changed.

If you run the application again you will see that that table has changed and the quantity of the item you entered has decreased by the amount you have chosen.

If you attempt to purchase more than what is currently in stock, a _**Not enough in stock!**_ message will appear and keep you from purchasing the item.
